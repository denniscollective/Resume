# In Brief:

I enjoy the challenge of working with human beings to create software the fills a real need. I've been making websites
since shortly after I was born, to that end, I am as interested in human aspects as I am the technical side of things.
I try to work sensibly and sustainably with teams who take pride in their work.

## I am not afraid of the words:


* Team
* Ruby
* Javascript
* Backbone
* Service Oriented Architecture (when it is appropriate)
* Object Oriented
* agile (so long as it's a lower case a)
* Lean
* TDD/BDD
* MVP
* Rails (well maybe sometimes a little afraid, but I've got 4 years experience with it)
* Business
* BOOM!

      Diaspora is a distributed open source social network. On joining the core team was burdened with
      a heavy operations cost, which was holding back development from being able to scale the platform
      effectively. Through a separation of client and server side applications, server throughput was
      increased by an order of magnitude. Development of the client as a Javascript Application (Backbone)
      allowed us to rapidly iterate on experimental experiences. We delivered a completely
      different product called Mark.io (https://makr.io/) on that utilized the existing server architecture.

      Through a simplification of Infrastructure (removing unnecessary services and dependencies) we
      were able to run Diaspora on the Heroku platform, allowing the developers/business owners to
      work on the areas we could innovate, and outsource the non business critical sectors."
