For my job history run:
    $ ruby resume.rb

In Brief:

I enjoy the challenge of working with human beings to create software the fills a real need. I've been making websites
since shortly after I was born, to that end, I am as interested in human aspects as I am the technical side of things.
I try to work sensibly and sustainably with teams who take pride in their work.

I am not afraid of the words:
* Team
* Ruby
* Javascript
* Backbone
* Service Oriented Architecture (when it's appropriate)
* Object Oriented
* agile (so long as it's a lower case a)
* Lean
* TDD/BDD
* MVP
* Rails (well maybe sometimes a little afraid, but I've got 4 years experience with it)
* Business
* BOOM!
